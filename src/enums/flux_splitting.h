* ALPACA is a MPI-parallelized C++ code framework to simulate compressible multiphase    *
* flow physics. It allows for advanced high-resolution sharp-interface modeling          *
* empowered with efficient multiresolution compression. The modular code structure       *
* offers a broad flexibility to select among many most-recent numerical methods covering *
* WENO/T-ENO, Riemann solvers (complete/incomplete), strong-stability preserving Runge-  *
* Kutta time integration schemes, level set methods and many more.                       *
