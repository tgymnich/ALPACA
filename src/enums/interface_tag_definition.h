* ALPACA is a MPI-parallelized C++ code framework to simulate compressible multiphase    *
* flow physics. It allows for advanced high-resolution sharp-interface modeling          *
* empowered with efficient multiresolution compression. The modular code structure       *
* offers a broad flexibility to select among many most-recent numerical methods covering *
* WENO/T-ENO, Riemann solvers (complete/incomplete), strong-stability preserving Runge-  *
* Kutta time integration schemes, level set methods and many more.                       *

/**
 * This info is to stay during development in case we need to further update the tagging-system, as currently functionality can only partially be tested.
 * Old Cut Cell           = 0 -> already cut-cell in last RK-step, still cut-cell. Is integrated in both RK steps.
 * New Cut Cell           = 1 -> no cut-cell in last RK-step, now a cut-cell. TODO-19 Check whether they can be neglected for integration in second RK step. Would be filled by mixing.
 *                        = 2 -> was a cut-cell in last RK-step, now empty/full cell close to interface TODO-19 JK not yet implemented. Could be helpful for mixing to avoid violation of conservation once cells should be empty but still contain conservatives.
 *
 * Cut-cell neighbour     = 3  -> indicates whether cell has a cut-cell neighbour, tags 0, 1 and 2 are dominating
 *
 *                        = 4  -> was a cut-cell in last RK-step, now empty/full cell away from interface.
 *
 * Extension-band         = 7  -> indicates whether fluid is extended in this region, tags 0, 1, 2 and 3 are dominating,
 *                                bit-shift gives width of extension (3 currently), keep this in mind when changing extension width!
 *
 * Reinitialization-band  = 8  -> indicates whether levelset is reinitialized in this region, usually one cell-layer more than extension-width,
 *                                depends on the order of the normal-calculation finite-difference scheme. Bit-shift gives width of reinitialization (4 currently), keep this in mind when changing reinitialization width!
 *
 * Bulk-face              = 10 -> indicates a bulk-face cell, tags 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 are dominating
 *
 * Scale-separation       = 50 -> whether a cell is scale-separated, only used/set in scale-separation, overwritten afterwards in SetInterfaceTags.
