* ALPACA is a MPI-parallelized C++ code framework to simulate compressible multiphase    *
* flow physics. It allows for advanced high-resolution sharp-interface modeling          *
* empowered with efficient multiresolution compression. The modular code structure       *
* offers a broad flexibility to select among many most-recent numerical methods covering *
* WENO/T-ENO, Riemann solvers (complete/incomplete), strong-stability preserving Runge-  *
* Kutta time integration schemes, level set methods and many more.                       *

 * @brief The RungeKutta3TVD class integrates in time using a total variation diminishing three-stage Runge-Kutta method. On paper the equations are
 *        I)    u^*     =       u^n              +       dt * f(u^n )
 *        II)   u^**    = 3/4 * u^n + 1/4 * u^*  + 1/4 * dt * f(u^* )
 *        III)  u^(n+1) = 1/3 * u^n + 2/3 * u^** + 2/3 * dt * f(u^**)
 *        To reduce the memory footprint the equations are reordered to allow the integration using three buffers only.
