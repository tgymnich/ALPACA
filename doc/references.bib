@article{Fu2016a,
  abstract = {Although classical WENO schemes have achieved great success and are widely accepted, they exhibit several shortcomings. They are too dissipative for direct simulations of turbulence and lack robustness when very-high-order versions are applied to complex flows. In this paper, we propose a family of high-order targeted ENO schemes which are applicable for compressible-fluid simulations involving a wide range of flow scales. In order to increase the numerical robustness as compared to very-high-order classical WENO schemes, the reconstruction dynamically assembles a set of low-order candidate stencils with incrementally increasing width. While discontinuities and small-scale fluctuations are efficiently separated, the numerical dissipation is significantly diminished by an ENO-like stencil selection, which either applies a candidate stencil with its original linear weight, or removes its contribution when it is crossed by a discontinuity. The background linear scheme is optimized under the constraint of preserving an approximate dispersion-dissipation relation. By means of quasi-linear analyses and practical numerical experiments, a set of case-independent parameters is determined. The general formulation of arbitrarily high-order schemes is presented in a straightforward way. A variety of benchmark-test problems, including broadband waves, strong shock and contact discontinuities are studied. Compared to well-established classical WENO schemes, the present schemes exhibit significantly improved robustness, low numerical dissipation and sharp discontinuity capturing. They are particularly suitable for DNS and LES of shock-turbulence interactions.},

  abstract = {We present a new adaptive numerical scheme for solving parabolic PDEs in Cartesian geometry. Applying a finite volume discretization with explicit time integration, both of second order, we employ a fully adaptive multiresolution scheme to represent the solution on locally refined nested grids. The fluxes are evaluated on the adaptive grid. A dynamical adaption strategy to advance the grid in time and to follow the time evolution of the solution directly exploits the multiresolution representation. Applying this new method to several test problems in one, two and three space dimensions, like convection-diffusion, viscous Burgers and reaction-diffusion equations, we show its second-order accuracy and demonstrate its computational efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
